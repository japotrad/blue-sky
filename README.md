Preparation chain generating bilingual bibk files from Aozora Bunko HTML documents

## Initial workflow to create a new document
### 1. Clean up the HTML file in Japanese
### 2. Produce the equivalent HTML file in English
You can have the file translated by a human or a machine.
Note: If your language is not English, don't worry: The process is the same for any language, not just English.
### 3. Add some extra information
### 4. Merge the files into a bibk file

## Iterative workflow to update an existing document
### - Update of the HTMLâ€¯file in Japanese
There are two distinct cases to consider depending whether the update impacts the main text or furiganas.
### - Update of the HTML file in English
### - Update of the Preface in English
### - Update of the Bibliographic Details
